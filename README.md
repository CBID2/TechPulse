ðŸš€ **Excited to share my latest projectâ€”** **"TechPulse"!** 

As I'm diving into the **MERN stack**, I built this **Tech News App** using the **Algolia News API** to practice and strengthen my React skills. Here's a quick rundown of what I incorporated:

ðŸ”¹ **useReducer** and **useContext** for efficient state management across the app.
ðŸ”¹ **Custom hooks** to handle specific logic, making the code more modular and reusable.
ðŸ”¹ **Pagination feature** to navigate through pages of news seamlessly, ensuring a smooth user experience.

This project was a great learning experience, and I'm eager to continue improving and expanding it. Check it out and let me know your thoughts!
